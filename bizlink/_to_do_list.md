# Upper navbar

# Shop

- A feature where an owner adds an admin to help with shop

# Signup

- I think it redirects to login even if there is an error
- Display the message registered successfully
- make it so it moves to the exact step in the multi step form the error occurred
- I think the code allows registeration as business owner and customer using the same email, decide if u want to allow that
